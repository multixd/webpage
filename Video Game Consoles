    <p title ="Video Game Generations"> &nbsp;
    All video game consoles can be divided into different <i>generations</i>.
    Most of the consoles we use today, such as the XBox One or the PlayStation 4,
    are considered to be in the eighth generation.
    While most of the first generation consoles are made around the early 1970s,
    popular ones include "Magnavox Odyssey" by Magnavox and "Home Pong" by Atari.</p>

    <p title ="First Generation"> &nbsp;
    Consoles from the First Generation, are dedicated consoles, consoles that can only play the game it came out with.
    The logic of games are coded to a console's microchip, therefore no other game can be added.
    These dedicated consoles are just called video games at the time, because their was little distinguishable between console and game.
    Atari's arcade game "Pong" popularized console games around that time.</p>

    <p title ="Second Generation"> &nbsp;
    The second generation of video game consoles started in the mid 1970s all the way until the early 1990s.
    Unlike First Generation's dedicated consoles, games are now burned inside ROM chips and placed inside cartilages.
    These cartilages can be placed inside a slot of the console, each cartilage will run a different game.
    Atari 2600's "Space Invaders" is the most successful second generation game ever.
    Poor quality, over-hyped games, along with an over-saturated  market caused the video game crash of 1983.
    Most gaming console companies such as Atari, Coleco, and Fairchild Technologies are bankrupted and discontinued.</p>
